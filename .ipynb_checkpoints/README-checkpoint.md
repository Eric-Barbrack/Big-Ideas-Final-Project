# Big-Ideas-Final-Project
The final project for Big Ideas and Information Lab, detailing the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. 

We started off with three data sets: Fire Incidents in Pittsburgh, Police Arrest Data, and a Current List of Events. When it comes to better neighborhoods, we decided that less fire incidents would be better, less arrests would be better, and more neighborhood events would be better. From the compiled data, we can determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
